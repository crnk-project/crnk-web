        <p>
            There are many libraries help building RESTful applications. The goal of this page
            is to compare those projects and put Crnk into perspective.
        </p>

        <p>
            In general we feel that JSON API has many beneficial properties when it comes to implementing
            resource-based RESTful applications. One of the main benefits to follow a common standard
            is demonstrated by the <a href="http://jsonapi.org/implementations/">JSON API implementations</a> page.
            It is an entrypoint into a rich ecosystem of libraries and tooling around JSON API, only made
            possible by all of those project following that standard. Similar benefits can also be achieved within
            larger applications where many developers are involved. A standard can guide the design and implementation.

            Some more benefits of JSON API are more subtile.
            For example, one of the more striking features of JSON API is the document structure with
            separated attributes, relationships, meta data and links data. This may seem at first like
            an additional burden, as an extra step has to be taken when looking up a relationship.
            But this normalization can have many highly useful properties that sets it apart from
            other REST frameworks. The benefits include for example:

        <ul>
            <li>The normalization brings support for complex object graphs with arbitrary, potentially cyclic
                relationships, such as parent/child relationships. With the <i>include</i> parameter
                those object graphs can be queried with a single request.
            </li>
            <li>
                The normalization works well together with newer Redux-style frontend applications.
                For example, <a href="https://github.com/abdulhaq-e/ngrx-json-api">ngrx-json-api</a>
                provides a neat integration of JSON API with Angular and ngrx. It is straightforward
                to put JSON API documents in a Redux store. There is no mapping layer necessary. And
                the Redux tooling will allow to denormalize resp. resolve relationships to have easy
                access in the presentation layer.
            </li>
            <li>
                While sightly harder to read, it is much easier to insert, update and delete normalized resources.
                There is not need to process complex object graphs as individual JSON API resources
                are conceptually simple. Also have a look at crnk-operations making use of JSON Patch
                to perform multiple operations atomically.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            Before diving into the various frameworks, maybe a suprising disclaimer. We <b>consider
            Crnk not to be limited to JSON API</b>. People can be quite opinionated about how
            their API is supposed to look like. JSON API then either matches or not. However,
            if necessary, it is perfectly possible to customize Crnk towards many requirements.
            Serializers and deserializers can be registered to customize how documents are marshalled to and
            from JSON. Similarly, the parsing of request parameters can be customized.
            <b>It is also thinkable to provide adapters into other standards such as GraphQL and OData</b>.
            More than likely, such integrations would be much simpler to achieve than writing a
            new framework from scratch. Many parts of the crnk engine, integrations and modules could be reused.
            Contributions in this area would be welcomed.
        </p>

        <p>
            Note also that this page is work in progress. More information will be provided.
            Any further insights are also welcomed.
        </p>

        <p>
        <h3>JAX-RS</h3>

        <p>
            Considered to be the standard when it comes to building RESTful applications.
            JAX-RS is easy to use. There are multiple implementations available. A drawback is that it is quite close
            to the transport layer. Plenty of declarations are necessary for each service (parameters, methods,
            body, url handling, content type, etc.). This in turn can lead to boiler-plate and inconsistent
            behavior in larger applications built by multiple developers. More opinionated specifications like
            JSON API can help here. In particular when it comes to things like sorting, filtering or
            complex object graphs, the speed-up and simplification can be quite dramatic.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is not uncommon that JSON API may not be able to cover all use cases of an application;
            but probably about 90% of them. For this reason, crnk works well together
            with JAX-RS as also highlighted in the documentation. Resource-based services are then implemented
            with JSON API, while other more custom services are implemented with JAX-RS.
            There is the possibility to benefit from some JSON API features in
            JAX-RS services. Crnk allows to use the JSON API exception handling in JAX-RS, providing
            a single common error mechanism among all services. And it allows JAX-RS services
            to return data in JSON API format. Have a look at the documentation for more information.
        </p>

        <p>
        <h3>Spring Data Rest</h3>

        <p>
            Similar to JSON API, Spring Data Rest has to goal to simplify the development of resource-based
            RESTful application. Like Crnk it provides an integration into JPA. It also has
            further integrations into other data stores that are currently still missing in
            Crnk (contributions welcomed).
        </p>

        <p>
            There are various areas where one can highly benefit from using Crnk over Spring Data Rest,
            with the JSON API specification itself potentially being the most important benefit:

        <ul>
            <li>
                The JSON API specification
                page lists countless implementations for various programming languages. Those
                go far beyond the Spring ecosystem.
            </li>
            <li>
                The JSON API specification and recommendations provide quite powerful tooling to
                deal with sorting, filtering, sparse field sets, complex object graphs,
                inclusions, etc. Various of those features go well beyond what is possible with
                Spring Data Rest.
            </li>
            <li>
                Crnk is lightweight and plays well together with any framework, not just Spring.
                For example, we expect to move into areas such as AWS Lambda and OpenWhisk soon
                where services are expected to be available instantly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Crnk allows the use of type-safe stubs by both Typescript and Java clients. Useful
                for both testing and client side development.
            </li>
            <li>
                Crnk is highly modular and provides you with all the flexibility you may or may not need.
            </li>
            <li>
                crnk-security can provide true resource-based access control which comes closer
                to data room access control than the more traditional service-based access control.
                As an example, it not only checks the access to a particular service method, but
                it can also (soon) check parameters accessing related resources.
            </li>
            <li>
                crnk-meta provides an extensive meta model tailored towards JSON API. As such it goes
                beyond what Spring Data provides with the ALPS meta-data. However, it is also thinkable
                to support ALPS at some point in the future.
            </li>
            <li>...</li>
        </ul>
        </p>


        <p>
        <h3>OData / Apache Olingo</h3>

        <p>
            We consider OData and JSON API to be quite similar in their goals. JSON API may can be considered
            to be a bit simpler and more accessible. And it also follows more closely the best practices
            for RESTful applications. It currently seems that there is not to much momentum anymore
            in OData.
        </p>

        <p>
            Apache Olingo is a Java implementation of OData. Given the closeness of the two approaches,
            implementing a crnk-adapter-odata would be a simple thing to achieve.
        </p>

        <p>
        <h3>Falcor</h3>

        Not unlike GraphQL, but it seems that there is more momentum towards GraphQL.

        </p>

        <p>
        <h3>GraphQL</h3>

        <p>
            Similar to Falcor one of the newer kids on the block. While GraphQL makes use of HTTP, it
            does not follow the REST principles. Instead it makes use of a query/response model
            into a single (virtual) JSON document. This gives rise to some interesting properties.
            But we also feel like it leads a bit to a loss of simplicity and accessibility, two
            of the most well regarded aspects of a RESTful API. How well that will play
            out in terms of user acceptance in the future first has to be determined. Given its young age,
            the ecosystem also has to mature a bit.
        </p>

        <p>
            JSON API can provide a simpler alternative.
            Its support for relationship inclusions and spare field sets are not too different from
            some GraphQL concepts (on an abstract/high level). For this reason support for a
            crnk-adapter-graphql module could be a good possibility to expose resources with GraphQL.
        </p>

        <p>
        <h3>Elide (JSON API)</h3>

        Elide is another Java implementation of the JSON API specification. It is comparable
        to the feature set of crnk-jpa. But in general Crnk targets a much wider scope supporting
        use cases other than JPA.

        </p>

        <p>
        <h3>Swagger</h3>

        Not actually a REST framework, but commonly used for documentation. For this reason, the question is rather
        whether Swagger supports JSON API or not. To some degree it is possible to document JSON API repositories
        with Swagger. However, in general we do not recommend doing that for various reasons:

        <ul>
            <li>
                Swagger does not follow the
                HATEOAS for linking (some would say deliberately). This gives JSON API and any othere REST framework
                following the HATEOAS principles a hard time. It is not possible to properly document this.
            </li>
            <li>
                Some other data structures like the JSON API inclusions cannot be properly modelled in Swagger.
            </li>
            <li>
                To some degree Swagger just respecifies JSON API. It is standardized how a JSON API repository
                is supposed to look like. There is no need to document this again. The only thing necessary
                to document is the list of attributes, relationships, meta and links, not how they
                are structured as document.
            </li>
            <li>
                JSON API specifies how parameters are supposed to look like (resp. gives recommendations).
                Swagger lacks the expressiveness to model those parameters to to the dynamic nature
                with the possibility to filter, sort and include attributes and relationships.
                As a result, the user interface barely allows to work with those parameters.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The general recommendation is to rather make use of a HATEOAS user interface that allows
            to explore the repositories and its data. crnk-ui is an example for that. The use
            crnk-meta further allows to not only browse the data, but also its meta-model, bringing
            along the same functionality as Swagger provides, but tailored towards JSON API.
        </p>

        <h3>ngrx-json-api</h3>

        <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/abdulhaq-e/ngrx-json-api">ngrx-json-api</a> is Angular library that provides an
            JSON API extension for the ngrx store. Currently seems like the being one of the most promising library in the
            Angular area. crnk-gen-typescript will soon provide the means to generate
            type-safe stubs for use with ngrx-json-api.
