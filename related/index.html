        <p>
            There are many libraries helping when it comes to building RESTful applications. The goal of this page
            is to put Crnk into perspective by comparing to those other projects.
        </p>

        <p>
            In general we feel
            that JSON API has many benefits when implementing resource based RESTful
            application. Those benefits are sometimes quite subtile and only come to light when designing
            more elaborate applications. For example, the document structure with attributes, relationships,
            meta data and links data can be considered being normalized. This may seem like an additional burden
            where other framework include relationships directly with a resource. There is no extra step
            to resolve relationships. But such a design can proof highly useful in many scenarios:

        <ul>
            <li>The normalization allows for complex object graphs with arbitrary, potentially cyclic
                relationships, such as parent/child relationships.
            </li>
            <li>
                The normalization works well together with newer Redux-style frontend applications.
                For example, <a href="https://github.com/abdulhaq-e/ngrx-json-api">ngrx-json-api</a>
                provides a very neat integration of JSON API with Angular and ngrx.
            </li>
            <li>
                While sightly harder to read, it is much easier to insert, update and delete. Also
                checkout crnk-operations to perform multiple operations simultaneously.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            Before diving into the various frameworks, maybe a suprising disclaimer. We <b>consider
            Crnk not to be limited to JSON API</b>. People can be quite opinionated how
            their API is supposed to look like. JSON API then either does or does not fit in there.
            However, it is quite simple to customize Crnk towards your requirements if really necessary.
            Custom serializers and deserializers allow to marshall request and response documents
            to your liking. Similarly, the parsing of request parameters can be customized as well.
            <b>It is also thinkable to provide adapters into other technologies such as GraphQL or OData</b>.
            More than likely, such integrations would be much simpler to achieve than writing a
            new framework from scratch. Many parts of the crnk engine, integrations and modules could be reused.
            Contributions in this area would be very welcomed.
        </p>

        <p>
            Note also that this page is considered to be work in progress. For sure there are more
            things to say and more updates will follow. Any insights are also welcomed.
        </p>

        <p>
        <h3>JAX-RS</h3>

        <p>
            Considered to be the standard when it comes to building RESTful applications.
            JAX-RS is easy to use. There are multiple implementations available. A drawback is that it is quite close
            to the transport layer. Plenty of declarations are necessary for each service (parameters, methods,
            body, url handling, content type, etc.). This in turn frequently leads to boiler-plate and inconsistent
            behavior
            in larger applications. More opinionated specifications like JSON API can help here.
            In particular when it comes to things like sorting, filtering, paging or
            complex object graphs, the speed-up and simplification can be quite dramatic.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is not unusual for JSON API not be able to cover all the use cases, but
            maybe 90% of them. For this reason, crnk works well together
            with JAX-RS as also shown in the documentation. Resource-based services are then implemented
            with JSON API, while other more custom services get implemented with JAX-RS.
            There is also the possibility to benefit of some JSON API features in
            JAX-RS services. It is possible to make use of the JSON API exception handling, providing
            a single common error mechanism among all services. It is also possible for JAX-RS services
            to return data in JSON API format. Have a look at the documentation for more information.
        </p>

        <p>
        <h3>Spring Data Rest</h3>

        <p>
            Similar to JSON API, Spring Data Rest has to goal to simplify the development of resource-based
            RESTful application. Just like Crnk it provides an integration into JPA. It also has
            further integrations into other data stores that are currently still missing in
            Crnk (contributions welcomed).
        </p>

        <p>
            There are various areas where one can highly benefit from using Crnk over Spring Data Rest,
            with the JSON API specification itself potentially being the most important benefit;

        <ul>
            <li>
                The JSON API specification
                page lists countless implementations for various programming languages. Those
                go far beyond the Spring ecosystem.
            </li>
            <li>
                The JSON API specification and recommendations provide quite powerful tooling to
                deal with sorting, filtering, paging, spare field sets, complex object graphs,
                inclusions, etc. Various of those features go well beyond what is possible with
                Spring Data Rest.
            </li>
            <li>
                Crnk is lightweight and plays well together with any framework, not just Spring.
                For example, we expect to move into areas such as AWS Lambda and OpenWhisk soon
                where as services are expected to be available instantly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Crnk allows the use of type-safe stubs by both Typescript and Java clients. Useful
                for both testing and client side development.
            </li>
            <li>
                Crnk is highly modular and provides you with all the flexibility you may or may not need.
            </li>
            <li>
                crnk-security can provide true resource-based access control which comes closer
                to data room access control than the more traditional service-based access control.
                As an example, it not only checks the access to a particular service method, but
                it can also (soon) check parameters accessing related resources.
            </li>
            <li>...</li>
        </ul>
        </p>


        <p>
        <h3>OData / Apache Olingo</h3>

        <p>
            We consider OData and JSON API to be quite similar in their goals. JSON API may can be considered
            to be a bit simpler and more accessible. And it also follows more closely the best practices
            for RESTful applications. It currently seems that there is not to much momentum anymore
            in OData.
        </p>

        <p>
            Apache Olingo is a Java implementation of OData. Given the closeness of the two approaches,
            implementing a crnk-adapter-odata would be a simple thing to achieve.
        </p>

        <p>
        <h3>Falcor</h3>

        Not unlike GraphQL, but it seems that there is more momentum towards GraphQL.

        </p>

        <p>
        <h3>GraphQL</h3>

        <p>
            Similar to Falcor one of the newer kids on the block. While GraphQL makes use of HTTP, it
            does not follow the REST principles. That gives some benefits.
            But we feel like it also leads to a loss of simplicity and accessibility, two
            of the most well regarded aspects of a RESTful API. How well that will play
            out seems currently open. Given its young age, the ecosystem also has to mature a bit.
        </p>

        <p>
            JSON API seems to be a simpler alternative to the use of GraphQL.
            Its support for relationship inclusions and spare field sets are not to different from
            some GraphQL concepts (on a very high level). So support for a crnk-adapter-graphql
            could be a possibility.
        </p>

        <p>
        <h3>Elide (JSON API)</h3>

        Elide is another Java implementation of the JSON API specification. It is comparable
        to the feature set of crnk-jpa. But in general Crnk targets a much wider scope supporting
        use cases other than JPA.
